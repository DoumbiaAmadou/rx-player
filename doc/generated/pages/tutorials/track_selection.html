<h1>Tutorial: Selecting a track</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-The%20goal%20of%20this%20tutorial"></a></p>
<h2>The goal of this tutorial</h2>
<p>The RxPlayer has an advanced API when it comes to track selection:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can list the available audio, video and/or text tracks and chose one of
them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can disable the current video and / or text track</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also give to the RxPlayer a set of preferences so it can make the
best choice by itself without manually having to choose the right track
for every content.
Those preferences can even be applied retro-actively (for example, to the
content currently being played), depending on your need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the RxPlayer declares multiple APIs to allow those different use cases,
the track selection API can seem intimidating and confusing at first.</p>
<p>This tutorial will help you understand what your options are, why you would use
an API instead of another one and how to use them.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-What%20is%20a%20%22track%22?"></a></p>
<h2>What is a &#x201C;track&#x201D;?</h2>
<p>We should first agree on what is a track, as a concept.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s take for example an italian film presented to an english-speaking
audience.</p>
<p>For that film, let&#x2019;s imagine those multiple &#x201C;audio tracks&#x201D;:</p>
<ul>
<li>one being the original audio track, in italian</li>
<li>one being a dub in the english language</li>
<li>another in english with accessibility features such as an audio description
of what visually happens in the film (for example, to give cues of what is
happening to the visually-impaired).</li>
</ul>
<p>There also could be multiple &#x201C;text tracks&#x201D;:</p>
<ul>
<li>subtitles in english</li>
<li>closed-captions in english (for example, for the hearing impaired)</li>
</ul>
<p>And we could even imagine multiple video tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>one displaying the &#x201C;regular&#x201D; film</li>
<li>another displaying either the same film from a different camera angle (seems
far-fetched here but let&#x2019;s just pretend we&#x2019;re talking about some kind of
experimental film!)</li>
</ul>
<p>All those will provide to the user a different way to offer the same film. They
even can technically be switched one independently of the other (though
restrictions on possible combinations can exist) to give a large number of
different experience for what is effectively the same content.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-Listing%20the%20available%20tracks"></a></p>
<h2>Listing the available tracks</h2>
<p><a name="subchapter-Preamble"></a></p>
<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>The RxPlayer does not &#x201C;guess&#x201D; the tracks available for a given content.
It usually finds every information about them in a specific file, called the
Manifest.</p>
<p>Thus, the list of available tracks will only be available once the RxPlayer has
loaded and parsed that Manifest.
Moreover, a Manifest can have several lists of available tracks depending on the
player&#x2019;s position (for example, a live channel with multiple programs might have
different audio languages available for different programs).</p>
<p>This means both that the available tracks won&#x2019;t generally be known just after a
<code>loadVideo</code> call and that it can then change at any time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most of this complexity is abstracted by the RxPlayer API.</p>
<p><a name="subchapter-Using%20methods"></a></p>
<h3>Using methods</h3>
<p>Once the RxPlayer has loaded the content (meaning the RxPlayer is not in the
<code>STOPPED</code>, <code>LOADING</code> or <code>RELOADING</code> <a href="../api/states.html">player state</a>) you can
begin to ask it what is the current list of available tracks.</p>
<p>This can be done through three RxPlayer methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-getAvailableAudioTracks"><code>getAvailableAudioTracks()</code></a>
to list audio tracks</li>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-getAvailableVideoTracks"><code>getAvailableVideoTracks()</code></a>
to list video tracks</li>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-getAvailableTextTracks"><code>getAvailableTextTracks()</code></a>
to list text tracks</li>
</ul>
<p>Those methods will all return arrays of objects, each object containing
information about a single track.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the information for an audio track won&#x2019;t be the same
than for a video or a text track.
For example, you might be interested by the height and width available in a
video track. Those notions make absolutely no sense for an audio track.</p>
<p>For more information about the structure of the data returned by those methods,
you can refer to their API documentation (a shortcut is available by clicking
on the method name).</p>
<p>Note that you can still ask for the current tracks when the RxPlayer does not
have loaded any content (is in the <code>STOPPED</code>, <code>LOADING</code> or <code>RELOADING</code> player
state), but you will most likely only get an empty array in those cases.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Those methods are straightforward, here are some examples of how they can be
used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-comment">// Array of all available audio languages</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> availableLanguages = rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .map(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">track</span> =&gt;</span> track.language);

<span class="hljs-comment">// List of audio tracks containing an audio description of what is visually</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// happening</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> audioDescriptionTracks = rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .filter(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">track</span> =&gt;</span> track.audioDescription);

<span class="hljs-comment">// List of video tracks for which a profile with a 1080p resolution is available</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> highResVideoTracks = rxPlayer.getAvailableVideoTracks()
  .filter(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">track</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> track.representations
      .some(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">representation</span> =&gt;</span> representation.height !== <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span> &amp;&amp;
                              representation.height &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">1080</span>);
  });

<span class="hljs-comment">// List of text tracks available in french</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> frenchTextTracks = rxPlayer.getAvailableTextTracks()
  .filter(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">track</span> =&gt;</span> track.normalized === <span class="hljs-string">&quot;fra&quot;</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><a name="subchapter-Using%20events"></a></p>
<h3>Using events</h3>
<p>If you want to have the list of available tracks as soon as possible, it might
be a good idea to rely on the related events.</p>
<p>Here are the three events you will need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="../api/player_events.html#events-availableAudioTracksChange"><code>&quot;availableAudioTracksChange&quot;</code></a>:
the list of available audio tracks was just updated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../api/player_events.html#events-availableVideoTracksChange"><code>&quot;availableVideoTracksChange&quot;</code></a>:
idem for video tracks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../api/player_events.html#events-availableTextTracksChange"><code>&quot;availableTextTracksChange&quot;</code></a>:
idem for video tracks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those events will have the corresponding available tracks as a payload,
which will be the exact same data that what you would get when calling the
corresponding <code>getAvailable...Tracks</code> method at this point.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Like any RxPlayer event, you will need to add an event listener for those:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> currentAudioTracks = [];
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> currentVideoTracks = [];
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> currentTextTracks = [];

rxPlayer.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;availableAudioTracksChange&quot;</span>, audioTracks =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;New audio tracks:&quot;</span>, audioTracks);
  currentAudioTracks = audioTracks;
})

rxPlayer.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;availableVideoTracksChange&quot;</span>, videoTracks =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;New video tracks:&quot;</span>, videoTracks);
  currentVideoTracks = videoTracks;
})

rxPlayer.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;availableTextTracksChange&quot;</span>, textTracks =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;New text tracks:&quot;</span>, textTracks);
  currentTextTracks = textTracks;
})
</code></pre>
<p><a name="subchapter-Should%20you%20use%20the%20methods%20or%20events?"></a></p>
<h3>Should you use the methods or events?</h3>
<p>Both the exposed methods and events return the same data.</p>
<p>Whether you should rely on the former or on the latter will depend on what
corresponds the most to your codebase:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you only want to fetch that list when the final user ask for it - for
example when he/she clicks on a button - it can be easier to just call the
methods.</p>
<p>You just have to make sure that you&#x2019;re not calling those (or that you&#x2019;re
hiding the corresponding button) when the player has not loaded any content
(when in the <code>STOPPED</code>, <code>LOADING</code> or <code>RELOADING</code> state).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you want to know that list and store it as soon as available, you might
prefer relying on the events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, you will obtain the same data, which corresponds to the currently
available tracks (of the content being watched and/or heard).</p>
<p><a name="chapter-Knowing%20the%20current%20track"></a></p>
<h2>Knowing the current track</h2>
<p>You might also want to know which track is the one currently selected.
There are several ways to know that.</p>
<p><a name="subchapter-Through%20methods"></a></p>
<h3>Through methods</h3>
<p>The RxPlayer has a set of methods that just return the currently active tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="../api/index.html#meth-getAudioTrack"><code>getAudioTrack</code></a>: return information
on the current audio track</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../api/index.html#meth-getVideoTrack"><code>getVideoTrack</code></a>: return information
on the current video track</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../api/index.html#meth-getTextTrack"><code>getTextTrack</code></a>: return information
on the current text track</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those methods will return an object describing the attributes of the current
tracks.
They can also return <code>null</code> if no track is enabled (for example, the user could
have wanted to disable all text tracks) and <code>undefined</code> if the track is either
unknown (which is a very rare possibility) or if no content is currently
playing.</p>
<p>Like the <code>getAvailable...Tracks</code> methods, the format of the objects returned
will entirely depend on which method you call. You can refer to the API
documentation to get more information on this.</p>
<p>Also like the <code>getAvailable...Tracks</code> methods, the current text track will
usually only be known once the RxPlayer has loaded a content (which means we are
not in the <code>STOPPED</code>, <code>LOADING</code> or <code>RELOADING</code> <a href="../api/states.html">player
state</a>). If no content is loaded, those APIs will just return
<code>undefined</code>.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Here is an example on how you could use them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> currentTextTrack = rxPlayer.getTextTrack();
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (currentTextTrack === <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;No text track is enabled&quot;</span>);
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (currentTextTrack === <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;We don&apos;t know the current text track. &quot;</span> +
              <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Are you sure a content is loaded?&quot;</span>);
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> language = currentTextTrack.language;
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;We have a current text track in the &quot;</span> + language + <span class="hljs-string">&quot;language&quot;</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p><a name="subchapter-Through%20events"></a></p>
<h3>Through events</h3>
<p>Exactly like you would obtain the list of available tracks through the
<code>available...TracksChange</code> events, you can know when the current track change as
soon as possible through the following events:</p>
<p><a name="subchapter-Through%20the%20list%20of%20available%20tracks"></a></p>
<h3>Through the list of available tracks</h3>
<p>As written earlier the <code>available...TracksChange</code> events and the
<code>getAvailable...Tracks</code> methods both return arrays of objects, each object
defining a single track.</p>
<p>In each of those object, you will find an <code>active</code> boolean property, which will
be set to <code>true</code> if the track is the currently chosen one and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>Note that it&#x2019;s possible that none of the available tracks are active. This is
for example the case when the track has been disabled (for example when the user
wants no text tracks at all).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-comment">// get the active audio track through `getAvailableAudioTracks`</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> activeAudioTrack1 = rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .find(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">track</span> =&gt;</span> track.active);

<span class="hljs-comment">// get the active audio track through `availableAudioTracksChange`</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> activeAudioTrack2;
rxPlayer.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;availableAudioTracksChange&quot;</span>, (tracks) =&gt; {
  activeAudioTrack2 = tracks.find(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">track</span> =&gt;</span> track.active);
});
</code></pre>
<p><a name="subchapter-Which%20one%20to%20use?"></a></p>
<h3>Which one to use?</h3>
<p>As usual here, this is highly dependant on your application. All of those APIs
give the same information through different means.</p>
<p>Accessing with the <code>get...Track</code> method is simple to use, the events allow to
know at the earliest possible time and relying on the list of available tracks
can simplify your code if you want both of them.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-Selecting%20a%20particular%20track"></a></p>
<h2>Selecting a particular track</h2>
<p>Now that we have the list of available tracks, we might want to choose one, or
let the final user choose one.</p>
<p>You will have to use one of those three RxPlayer methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-setAudioTrack"><code>setAudioTrack()</code></a>: change the current
audio track</li>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-setVideoTrack"><code>setVideoTrack()</code></a>: change the current
video track</li>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-setTextTrack"><code>setTextTrack()</code></a>: change the current
text track</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those methods take a single string as argument. That string should be
the value of the <code>id</code> property of the chosen track.</p>
<p>For example, to choose the first audio track with an audio description, you can
do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> firstAudioTrackWithAD = rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .find(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">track</span> =&gt;</span> track.audioDescription);

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (firstAudioTrackWithAD !== <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>) {
  rxPlayer.setAudioTrack(firstAudioTrackWithAD.id);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that those APIs only allow to change the current track and will have no
impact on the other contents you will encounter in the future.
Depending on your application, you might also want to set a global preference at
some point, such as saying that the final user will prefer english audio
tracks for now on.</p>
<p>Although <code>setAudioTrack</code> can be used for this use case - by just setting an
english audio track every times the available audio tracks list change (we can
know that through the <code>availableAudioTracksChange</code> event) - it is much more
efficient and less cumbersome to use audio track preference APIs for that.
Those will be described later in this tutorial, so stay with me!</p>
<p><a name="chapter-Disabling%20a%20track"></a></p>
<h2>Disabling a track</h2>
<p>Now what if you want no track at all?</p>
<p>This is for example a frequent need for text tracks, where you might prefer to
have no subtitles or closed captions appearing on the screen.</p>
<p>You could also want to disable the video track, which is a trick often used to
reduce the network bandwidth used by a content.</p>
<p>You can disable respectively the current text track and the current video track
by calling those methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-disableTextTrack"><code>disableTextTrack</code></a></li>
<li><a href="../api/index.html#meth-disableVideoTrack"><code>disableVideoTrack</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, like for selecting a track, this only concerns the current content
being played. When playing a new content or even when just switching to another
part of the content with a different track list, you might need to re-do the
same method call.</p>
<p>This is problematic most-of-all when disabling the video track, as going in and
out of that usually requires a short but visible &#x201C;re-loading&#x201D; step by the
RxPlayer. You want thus to limit the need to call <code>disableVideoTrack</code> every
times a new content is encountered.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the RxPlayer has another set of API to let you choose a track even
for future contents: the &#x201C;track preferences APIs&#x201D;.</p>
